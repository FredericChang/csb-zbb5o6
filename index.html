      <p>
        Keukenhof is located in the province of South Holland, south of Haarlem
        and southwest of Amsterdam in the area called the "Dune and Bulb Region"
        (Duin- en Bollenstreek). It is accessible by bus from Haarlem and Leiden
        train stations as well as Schiphol. Though its grounds are open
        year-round for private affairs and festivals, Keukenhof is only open to
        the general public for a world-renowned 8 week tulip display from
        mid-March to mid-May,[5] with peak viewing arriving near mid-April,
        depending on growing season weather, which varies annually. In 2019, 1.5
        million people visited Keukenhof,[6] equivalent to 26,000 visitors per
        day.[7] By comparison, the Rijksmuseum receives an average of 8,000
        visitors per day, the Efteling receives 14,000.

      <p>
        One of Amsterdam’s many bridges is the beautiful Magere Brug, known to English speakers at the Skinny Bridge. This wooden drawbridge was once so narrow that it was hard for two pedestrians to pass each other. To cope with increasing traffic on the Amstel, a wider bridge replaced the narrow original in 1871.
