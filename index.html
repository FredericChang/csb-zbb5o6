      <p>
        Keukenhof is located in the province of South Holland, south of Haarlem
        and southwest of Amsterdam in the area called the "Dune and Bulb Region"
        (Duin- en Bollenstreek). It is accessible by bus from Haarlem and Leiden
        train stations as well as Schiphol. Though its grounds are open
        year-round for private affairs and festivals, Keukenhof is only open to
        the general public for a world-renowned 8 week tulip display from
        mid-March to mid-May,[5] with peak viewing arriving near mid-April,
        depending on growing season weather, which varies annually. In 2019, 1.5
        million people visited Keukenhof,[6] equivalent to 26,000 visitors per
        day.[7] By comparison, the Rijksmuseum receives an average of 8,000
        visitors per day, the Efteling receives 14,000.
